                <h2>Major Sale</h2>
                <br>
				<p>Our major sale happened in 2018 with an income of 1 Billion Indian Ruppee</p>
				<p>Marketing and sales differ greatly, but they generally have the same goal. Selling is the final stage in marketing which puts the plan into effect. A marketing plan includes pricing, promotion, place, and product (the 4 P's). A marketing department in an organization has the goals of increasing the desirability and value of the products and services to the customer and increasing the number and engagement of successful interactions between potential customers and the organization. Achieving this goal may involve the sales team using promotional techniques such as advertising, sales promotion, publicity, and public relations, creating new sales channels, or creating new products. It can also include encouraging the potential customer to visit the organization's website, contact the organization for more information, or interact with the organization via social media channels such as Twitter, Facebook and blogs. Social values play a major role in consumer decision processes. Marketing is the whole of the work on persuasion made for the whole of the target people. Sales is the process of persuasion and effort from one person to one person (B2C), or one person to a corporation (B2B), in order to make a living resource enter the company. This may occur in person, over the phone or digitally.

The field of sales process engineering views "sales" as the output of a larger system, not just as the output of one department. The larger system includes many functional areas within an organization. From this perspective, the labels "sales" and "marketing" cover several processes whose inputs and outputs supply one another. In this context, improving an "output" (such as sales) involves studying and improving the broader sales process, since the component functional areas interact and are interdependent.[7]</p>

				<p>I remember it like it was yesterday. I was sitting in the wooden pews in the 6th row of the Catholic church. The priest had just done incense and my dad got up to do the ushering service. Between all the Latin and hearing about money and hell, I knew I didn’t understand something.
                    The priest told us some things we can never know and that we have to wait until we die, but I knew I didn’t want to wait until I die. 32 years later, I was living in an 8-million-dollar house in the Hollywood Hills.
                    It was a long way from Lake Charles, Lousiana where that Catholic church sat. My mom came to visit and we went to Ralph’s (the local supermarket) and she saw beans were $1.69. “I can get these for a quarter in Lake Charles,” she would say. She also complained about the cost of artichokes, which were maybe $6</p>
