    <h1>46 Online Business Ideas You Can Start Today</h1><br><br><br>
    <p>It seems that there’s no shortage of great online business ideas. According to hostingfacts.com, there are 966 million websites in the world today and WordPress alone is responsible for over 76.5 million blogs.
        Although there’s no one accurate figure, some studies suggest that over 100 million freelancers around the world are successfully running small online businesses from their homes.
        The perks of being your own boss seem so great that many are willing to quit their stable jobs to embark on this entrepreneurial journey to start making your own money
        So if you’re quietly contemplating the idea of starting something of your own, here’s a list of the most popular online business ideas that are within the reach of almost anyone who’s willing to take the plunge.
        Online Business Ideas You Can Start Today
        Here is the list of the top 46 online business ideas to get you started instantly.
        1. Travel consultant
        Do you spend more time packing and unpacking your luggage than most of the people you know? Then you might be onto something! Travelling is one of the greatest passions of this age — the crazier and more nomadic, the better! If you have a knack for organizing memorable, authentic trips and enjoy the process of creating exciting day-to-day plans, why not do it for money? Become a travel consultant to help adventure-seekers plan their unforgettable holidays from A to Z and enjoy every second of your working day.
        2. Get baking!
        From freshly baked butter croissants to colorful macaroons and pillow-soft morning bagels — the world of the great bake-off is a rich and ever-growing place. The beautiful thing about the online world is that a great passion can be turned into a great business almost overnight.
        </p>

        <p>3. Wedding planner
            If spending hours pinning images of gorgeous table arrangements and bouquet ideas on Pinterest is your definition of a perfect job, then you will make an exceptional wedding planner. Sharp project management skills and an eye for detail are pretty much the most important requirements for this job — no fancy diplomas to stop you from breaking into this industry! You can sell your consulting services, wedding decorations, game packages, personalized gifts — the list of possibilities is endless (well, almost).
            4. Party/corporate events planner
            Event planning is a bit like wedding planning, just on steroids. The scope of this idea is so large that it includes everything from cheesy stag and hen do parties to sophisticated product launches. Again, the entry barriers are rather low, but a flush work portfolio and a few glowing testimonials are something you need to consider to get a good head start in this field.
            5. Foreign language teacher
            Everyone knows that the quickest way to learn a new language is to mingle with native speakers. If you were lucky enough to be born in an English, French, Spanish (insert any of the world’s main languages) speaking country, then missing out on the opportunity to cash in on the skills you take for granted is exactly that — missing out! Use online communication tools, such as Skype or Google Hangouts, to connect with learners and leverage your privileges. Time is money, so package your hours into teaching sessions and you’re good to go.
            6. Translator
            If you are gifted a more than one language but have no interest in teaching others, try translating. Many companies need their website and collateral translated when they move into a different market. You can help them achieve it, while also keeping active in more than one language. Keep in mind the most common way of billing is cost per word so price wise to make smart money from this great online business idea.
            7. Open a T-Shirt online shop
            Platforms like Spreadshirt and Shopify have made it insanely simple to start an online t-shirt business for anyone with a speck of imagination and an eye for design.
            </p>
            <p>8. Handmade goods shop
                It can take you less than a day to build a storefront to showcase your work and connect with customers on platforms like Amazon and Etsy. If you’re into crafts and DIY, it’s definitely a viable business option to consider.
                9. Online researcher
                Although it sounds like a too-good-to-be-true idea, some people are successfully earning a living off their skill to find information online. From data research for infographics to market research for budding startups, talented researchers know that you can put a price tag on knowledge.
                10. Content curation
                The German Economist Schumpeter once said that there are “no original ideas”, only new combinations of old ones. Curation of curiosity-fueling content is an intriguing and little-known business model. One of the best success stories out there is Brainpickings — a platform that describes itself as “an inventory of cross-disciplinary interestingness, spanning art, science, design, history, philosophy, and more”. The subscription-based model and successful utilization of affiliate links have turned the blog into a self-sustaining business.
                11. Become a private chef
                If cooking is one of your personal passions, there are dozens of opportunities to turn it into a decent business venture. You can start by setting up a catering website, experimenting with pop-up food stalls and local food markets, or joining platforms that encourage cooking enthusiasts to squeeze some money out of their passion. And if you’re not camera-shy, you can teach people how to cook special meals by selling online classes.</p>
                <p>12. Dropshipping
                    Dropshipping is the easiest option to start an ecommerce business without having to buy any products in advance. Sell a variety of products to customers across the world, while setting your own process, building and promoting your own brand, all without needing to invest in warehousing or manufacturing costs. You don’t need to pay for inventory until it’s sold to an actual customer. Check out our guide to mastering dropshipping to learn more about this great business opportunity.
                    13. Fresh produce delivery
                    Organic, fresh food is somewhat of a modern craze. Fruit and vegetable deliveries, local farm boxes, and freshly-made goodies from local producers can help you kick off a business that not only encourages a healthier lifestyle but also supports the local economy.
                    14. Social media manager
                    Social media is an integral part of any business but it’s time-consuming and ever-changing — so really quite difficult to keep up with and, more importantly, capitalize on. Many business owners are willing to outsource this time-intensive task, so it’s a great opportunity for social media fanatics. Bundle together a few interesting offers, such as “Startup social media kit” or “Small Business Social Media Starter Kit” that encompass everything from social media graphics to analytics reports and the seamless experience will bring you more clients than you expect.
                    </p>
                    <p>15. Kickstarter/Indiegogo advisor
                        Grabbing the attention of curious browsers on the most popular crowdsourcing platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo is a tough job. If you’re inventive and know how to tap into human emotion, then this is a niche worth exploring. Many aspiring entrepreneurs look for personalized advice to carry their campaigns to the finish line, so try offering action-oriented eBooks or online courses targeted at this particular audience.
                        16. Remote sales team
                        As more and more companies take on the lean, mean approach to business, outsourcing cold calling and telesales functions becomes a sort of standard in the startup and small business environment. Whether you want to sell highly-targeted sales pitches or customer data, such as phone numbers and email addresses, the potential is vast.
                        17. Remote Customer Service Agent
                        If you enjoy helping people but don’t want to be stuck in a call center or office all day, become a remote customer service agent and help people from the comfort of your own home. Choose between helping people via chat, email, phone, video, or other ways and save the day for people every day. This may not make you your first million, but it feels great to help people.
                        18. Virtual Assistant
                        Similar to a remote customer service agent you can do a role that would traditionally be done in an office but you can do it at home. A virtual assistant can mean anything from a data entry person to a researcher so don’t limit yourself with this role, be open to try new things and uncover new skills while getting paid.
                        </p>
                        <p>19. SEO expert
                            One of the online world’s hottest professions at the moment, this business is a gold mine for the tech-savvy entrepreneurs. While everyone’s slightly obsessed with getting their sites SEO optimized, not many people can actually wrap their heads around this topic. If you decide to go into this field, you can think about offering link building, content creation, on-page SEO optimization, and similar one-off packages.
                            20. Selling online courses
                            Derek Halpern has built a really strong personal brand. He’s the founder of a software and business training company called Social Triggers and makes a LOT of money teaching people how to sell what they know best. And what he knows best is how to sell. If you’ve got some serious expertise, start making money out of it by selling online courses or simply teaching online.
                            21. CV writing
                            Banging out a winning CV is a mission impossible for many. If you’re good with words and know how to highlight people’s best qualities, CV writing could be a pretty sweet place to start a business. Additionally, you can sell slick CV templates that will help job hunters to get noticed faster and yield better results.
                            22. Speech writing
                            Giving speeches is a terrifying experience. Giving bad speeches… Well, no one wants to be in that situation. Wordsmiths have a hugely sellable skill to win people over using nothing else but the power of well-strung sentences. If you can write, cash in on this skill by crafting speeches that make birthdays, weddings, award ceremonies, or political debates a more memorable experience.</p>
                            <p>23. Public speaking coach
                                Naturally, the next one on the list is coaching people how to deliver great speeches. Public speaking is the number one fear on most people’s list — some fear it more than death! This skill can prove to be handy in many areas — from pitching to investors, to delivering key messages at global conferences. If you’re a natural on stage, help entrepreneurs rediscover their in-born ability to communicate by selling effective presentation templates and online coaching classes.
                                24. Self-published author
                                If you have the next Harry Potter manuscript sitting in your drawer and the publishing industry hasn’t been kind to you, try self-publishing. Using tools like Amazon’s direct publishing or working with dedicated consultants like I_Am, you not only get the satisfaction of pushing your work out there but also retain 100% of your royalties! Don’t think you can write a good novel? Then stick to what you know — self-help is a money-making genre!
                                25. Ghostwriter
                                If writing is your thing but you are lacking a topic to write about become a ghostwriter for someone else. If normally requires you to write about someone or something in a lot of detail. It can take time and much research to finish this type of project so be sure to have a few months free to give to it.</p>
                                <p>26. Proof Reader
                                    If, on the other hand, you love reading but not so much writing, becoming a proofreader could be your calling. Have other people send you their manuscripts for books, research papers, or whatever else you are interested in reading about, and give them honest feedback before they publish their works of art. This job requires attention to detail and expertise in the area to ensure that everything is ready to print.
                                    27. Dating coach
                                    Online and mobile dating are booming. Thousands of people around the world are looking for love online and, unfortunately, many are unsuccessful in their quest. As a dating coach, you’d be responsible for helping your clients to organize and prepare for a perfect date, to refine their flirting skills and to advise on the do’s and don’ts of a dating life.
                                    28. Mystery shopper
                                    Okay, it can be rather difficult to make a living solely from this but it’s a great place to start if you’re planning to build your own mystery shoppers’ army. Customer experience is one of the biggest obsessions of online and offline retailers, so there’s great potential here! Take a look at some of the existing platforms here and here.

        32. Investment advisor
        A lot of people with middle-class income would like to create a robust investment portfolio to secure a financially stable future but simply have no clue where to start. If you have professional experience as an investment analyst or do a lot of investment yourself, then offering investment advice for middle-class investors is a natural move for you.
        33. Mystery objects shop
        If you have an eye for quirky stuff, maybe running a mystery object shop could help you combine the thirst for curious things with a steady source of income. TheSomethingStore and Muddy Creatures are nailing the concept of a surprise purchase that taps into the explorer instinct many of us possess. There’s no exact science or skill fueling this business idea — let your imagination go wild…
        </p>
        <p>34. Interior Design Consultants

Do you sift through magazines, clipping images, sorting them into make-believe rooms in your scrapbook wanting desperately to see these rooms for real?

You can use the likes of a VR tool to pick furniture from real stores and choose a color scheme that suits the owner. The sky is the limit with this role and creativity is in full flow.
            35. Relationship coach
            Some people just seem to intuitively know more than others — they don’t get involved in destructive relationships or suffer from loss of self-knowledge. If you can relate to that description and feel your relationships have been fairly happy and stable, then maybe you’re one of them. You’ll need to invest in relevant workshops and books, get knowledgeable and certified before you can start coaching others, but it’s a fascinating business idea that will reward you both financially and morally.
            </p>
            <p>36. Nutritionist

Yet with so much contradictory advice online about what is good for us and what is not, more and more people turn to professional nutritionists for specialist tips and guidance. You can easily find free online courses to learn the fundamentals of this profession and start offering personalized nutrition plans online.
                37. Yoga instructor
                Selling yoga classes online is a great source of income. There are hundreds of sites like Reflexion Yoga or Yogaia that offer these services but they all have one thing in common — the classes are taught by pros. To capitalize on this huge trend you’ll either have to team up with a great yoga teacher or be one yourself.</p>
                <p>38. Makeup artist
                    Lots of successful makeup artists started their career on YouTube. All you need is a strong portfolio and a professional-looking website to get this gig going. Offer a couple of free makeup sessions to build your reputation and use content marketing to spread the word online.

                    40. Personal trainer

She’s built a whole Kayla Fitness empire and grown her services from simply writing personal training plans to selling official fitness apps and books.
