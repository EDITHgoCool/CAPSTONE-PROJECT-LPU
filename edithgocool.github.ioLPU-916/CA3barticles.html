				<h2>WAXING PROCEDURE: MYTHS AND FACTS</h2>
				<p><pre style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 0.5cm;"> Body waxing is a beauty procedure and a semi-permanent hair 
                    removal which is greatly demanded in Dubai and the world in general. 
                    Almost every part of the 
                    body can be waxed and there are many waxing procedures suitable for 
                    removing those unwanted hairs.

                    MYTH: AFTER WAXING, HAIRS GET THICKER AND GROW FASTER.
                    When waxing is made improperly, there are tendencies that the
                    hairs were not completely removed from the root and this result to
                    faster and thicker re-growth.
                    A professional esthetician is recommended in performing this
                    procedure in other to have the
                    hairs properly removed from the root.
                    
                    MYTH: WAXING IS PAINFUL.
                    In fact, this procedure greatly depends on areas/parts of the 
                    body where hairs are removed and the individual level of pain tolerance.
                    
                    MYTH: WAX KILLS ANY BACTERIA THAT IS WHY WAXING PROCEDURE IS SAFE.
                    It is true that waxing serves as a disinfectant to the body? 
                    However, a specialist is required to use disposable tools for this
                    hair removal. It is also 
                    advisable to have all necessary discussion with the specialist
                    before the procedure begins.
                    
                    MYTH: IF HAIRS GROW VERY FAST, IT MEANS THAT THE PROCEDURE 
                    HAS NOT BEEN CARRIED OUT IN A PROPER WAY. 
                    This statement is partially true. However, we should also note that 
                    some factors may also influence quick hair growth, such as; hair growth cycle, 
                    genetics, the area where hair wasn’t properly removed and even the season.

                    MYTH: WAX IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET BURNED.
                    Actually, it all depends on the equipment used in the spa salon.
                    There are several types of hair removal tools – with and without temperature control.
                    Besides, sometimes wax is heated in a microwave oven, where it can be 
                    possibly overheated.
                    
                    MYTH: THE LONGER THE HAIRS ARE, THE EASIER THEY CAN BE REMOVED.
                    In fact, the optimum hair length is 3-5 mm. It is really of no 
                    mportance waiting for hairs to get longer before waxing, as this can result to more 
                    pain during the procedure. Besides, there are also tendencies of “hair breakages” 
                    instead  of totally removing them from the root.
                    
                    MYTH: IT IS EASY TO MAKE WAXING PROCEDURE AT HOME.
                    With a visit to spa salons, we may think that waxing procedures
                    are primitively simple. In reality, this treatment is not so easy
                    to perform without
                    professional skills. This is especially true for the bikini area.
                    
                    MYTH: WAX CAUSES WRINKLES.
                    Actually; owing to regular waxing procedures, skin becomes
                    better because dead skin cells are removed along with the hairs and this
                    leads to the rapidskin 
                    regeneration.</pre></p>

				<h2>BRAZILIAN KERATIN TREATMENT: ADVANTAGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS</h2><br><br>
				<p><pre style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 0.5cm;">
                    There are great and several ways/techniques to enhance your beauty
                     and one of these revolutionary techniques is the Brazilian Keratin 
                     Hair Treatment.

                    WHAT IS THE PROCEDURE
                    Brazilian Keratin Treatment is a cosmetic procedure that turns 
                    unruly curls into perfectly straight hair. This technique is very s
                    imilar to perming, but has
                     the opposite effect: hair straightening and no chemicals are 
                     used.
                    
                    It should be noted that this treatment is suitable not only for
                     girls desiring straightened hair. Note that aggressive external 
                     factors negatively affect 
                    our hairs. The impact of warm and cold air, UV rays, chlorinated 
                    and sea water, 
                    
                    constant use of 
                    cosmetic products for hair styling – all this leads to hair damage 
                    and, as a 
                    
                    consequence,
                     hair shaft becomes porous and rough. Damaged hair loses its shine,
                      begins electrifying and
                     becomes unruly dull and lifeless. Brazilian Keratin Treatment is 
                     the key 
                     
                     to solving these problems.
                    
                    ADVANTAGES OF THE HAIR TREATMENT
                    It is not a chemical procedure, but an intensive treatment 
                    which makes your hair soft and shiny. This hair cosmetic product
                    
                    does not contain harmful 
                    chemicals. Instead of this, it contains a keratin which our hair consists of.
                    Unlike other hair cosmetic products, Brazilian Keratin
                     Treatment is suitable for any hair type: Slavic, Asian, European
                     
                     and African-American.
                    The treatment can be used after any chemical procedures: 
                    coloring, highlighting, straightening, perming, and bleaching.
                    Brazilian keratin improves hair quality. Upon every use 
                    of this treatment, your hair gets better and looks shiny, 
                    
                    healthy and well-groomed.
                    RECOMMENDATIONS:
                
                    The beauty of Brazilian Keratin Treatment can be noticed 
                    for 2-3 months and thereafter the procedure can be repeated. 
                    
                    Frequent application of this 
                    hair treatment improves the hair and enhances styling.
                    Do not wash your hair for three or four days after applying 
                    the treatment. That's because the solution takes time to work 
                    
                    effectively.
                    If you wish to change the color of your hair, it is 
                    recommended you do this before the procedure. When coloring, it 
                    
                    is important to understand 
                    that Brazilian Keratin Treatment slightly bleaches the hair. For 
                    
                    this reason, it is 
                    recommended to use a color shade darker than desired before the 
                    
                    treatment procedure. After the 
                    treatment, you can color your hair not earlier than 2 weeks after 
                    
                    procedure.
                    If you want to maintain the keratin effect, it is recommended 
                    to use only sulfate-free shampoos.
                    Brazilian Keratin Treatment is greatly appreciated not just 
                    in Dubai, but the world in general. Famous celebrities; 
                    
                    Nicole Ricci, Jennifer Lopez, Jennifer
                    Aniston, Halle Berry, all use these treatments.</pre> </p>
